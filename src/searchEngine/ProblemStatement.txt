To enhance the user experience on your new tech blog, you want to create an in-memory search engine.

The search engine should support the creation of categories - representing collections of blog articles, and allow documents (articles) to be inserted into specific categories.

Users should be able to search through articles in a given category based on search patterns, such as a sequence of words, with the potential to support more complex patterns in the future (e.g., unordered keyword matches, ordered sequences, or exact substring matches).

The search results should initially be ordered by the most recently published articles, with flexibility to support additional criteria like most recently updated, most searched articles, or author-name based ordering.

Non-functional requirements include optimising for fast query processing, particularly aiming for constant time (O(1)) for unordered search operations.
